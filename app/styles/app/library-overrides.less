// seems to be a small bug in ui-select that makes the search box have a
// really tiny width (like 10px) until you click elsewhere in the app which
// forces some update to happen and makes the width 100%.  Here I'm just forcing
// this to happen right away
.ui-select-multiple input.ui-select-search {
    width: 100% !important;
}
